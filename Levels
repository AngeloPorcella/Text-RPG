You have been sentenced to death for crimes you did not commit by a corrupt king who has a personal vendetta against you.
Your mission is to survive and get your revenge.

Room #1:Cell
You wake up in a jail cell with a rusted spoon[weapon], lumpy straw mattress[searchable], and a "bathroom" bucket[item] present on the floor around you.
A guard[use application] sits sleeping on a stool within arms reach of the bars a pocket sits out of reach
If you inspect the straw mattress you find a metal wire you fashion into a hook[item].
    You can use the hook on the guard to take a key.
    Using the key on the door opens and awakens the drunk guard.
        Battle ensues
        If you don't pick up the spoon he easily defeats you since you are unarmed(if you are unarmed you instantly die).
        Defeating the guard advances you into the next room:
If you pick up the bucket and throw it on the guard he wakes up screaming "I don't get paid enough for this!" and runs away
    The key falls out of his pocket within arms reach.
    You are able to unlock the door and exit without issue and advance to the next room.

Room #2: Armory
You enter a dimly lit room with a longsword[weapon], a deck of cards[item], a candle[item] sitting on a table.
A cannon is aimed towards a barred window[use App].
    Using the Candle on the cannon fires it through the window granting passage to the street below:

Room #3: Wizard Tower
An approaching group of guards forces you to take refuge inside a nearby wizard's tower.
You find yourself in an antechamber with a door with strange symbols and an animated skeleton with a rune in its hand is standing facing the corner.
A glowing crystal floats within it's ribcage.
    Using the metal hook on the skeleton causes it to fall apart allowing you to pick up the rune.
    Using the rune on the door allows you to proceed to the next room.
Any other action causes the skeleton to turn on you and you must fight it to obtain the rune

Room #4: Portal Room
Yeah this aint getting done
