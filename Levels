Room #1:Cell
You wake up in a jail cell with a rusted spoon[weapon], lumpy straw mattress[searchable], and a "bathroom" bucket[item] present on the floor around you.
A guard[use application] sits sleeping on a stool within arms reach of the bars a pocket sits out of reach
If you inspect the straw mattress you find a metal wire you fashion into a hook[item].
    You can use the hook on the guard to take a key.
    Using the key on the door opens and awakens the drunk guard.
        Battle ensues
        If you don't pick up the spoon he easily defeats you since you are unarmed(if you are unarmed you instantly die).
        Defeating the guard advances you into the next room:
If you pick up the bucket and throw it on the guard he wakes up screaming "I don't get paid enough for this!" and runs away
    The key falls out of his pocket within arms reach.
