This is an unnamed outline for a text-based RPG.

The functionality in terms of player choice is somewhat limited, but could easily be expanded into something more complex.

'Rooms' consist of loops where a 'key' is found and applied to the proper object. When the exit condition is met, you are moved onto the next room.

Utilizes a REPL interface to interact with environments. This outline consists of 2 'rooms' and 2 combat encounters, including a couple ways to solve the 1st.
The ending is a total deus ex machina but I don't care it just needed a conclusion.
